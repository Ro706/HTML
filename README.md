A Simple HTML Document
```shell
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
# Example Explained

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.<br>
The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.<br>
The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page.<br>
The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).<br>
The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br>
The `<h1>` element defines a large heading.<br>
The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.<br>

What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
```shell
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
```
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
```shell
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
```
Start tag   Element content	End tag
<h1>	    My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	   My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	            none	none

Name the file `"index.htm"` and set
 the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the 
preferred encoding for HTML files).
